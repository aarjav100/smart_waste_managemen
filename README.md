# Smart Waste Management Dashboard

A real-time web dashboard for monitoring smart waste bins. The system displays the fill level of multiple bins using simulated sensor data and provides both list and map views of bin locations and their current status.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of bin fill levels
- Interactive map view with bin locations
- Color-coded status indicators (Empty, Half-full, Full)
- Simulated sensor data updates
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 13 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Leaflet for maps
- Heroicons for icons
